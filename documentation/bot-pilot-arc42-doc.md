# Deployment View

## Infrastructure Dev-Stage

The following infrastructure elements are used in the development
stage of the system.

![Deployment View Dev Stage MVP-Phase](./images/deployment_view/deployment_view_dev_stage_mvp.png)

### Motivation

During the MVP-Phase, the Dev-Stage Server is a virtual machine running on
a developers machine.
A client website can import the bot-pilot using *iframe* or *script* tag. The *src*
needs
to point to the Dev-Stage Server from where the frontend is served.
As a Loadbalancer, a simple *Caddy* webserver is used. This webserver is responsible for
routing the requests to the frontend. While developing in the MVP-Phase, the
microservcies for
backend functionality, the frontend and the caddy webserver are all running on the same
machine.
To run them, a docker-compose file is used. Doing so, the early product stage can be
deployed easily
to evaluate the infrastructure and the architecture at this very early stage.
The frontend is served using the React framework with Typescript and vite as bundle
tool.
The Rasa Server (Core + NLU) is running with `Sanic`, an asynchronous web framework.
The Rasa Action-Server is running with `Flask` and is not implemented asynchronous.
